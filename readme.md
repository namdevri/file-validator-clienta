## Lets Get it Started

[Intro: Fergie, apl.de.ap, Both]
Let's get it started in here
And the bass keeps runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'
And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'
And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'
And runnin', runnin, and runnin', runnin' and

[Verse 1: will.i.am; will.i.am & Fergie; will.i.am, apl.de.ap & Fergie]
In this context, there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme, you break yo necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect and let the rhythm effect
To lose this inhibition, follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
'Cause when we be out, girlies pull they weave out
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out
Burn it 'til it's burned out, turn it 'til it's turned out
Actin' up from north, west, east, south

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am, will.i.am & Fergie, All]
Everybody (Yeah), everybody (Yeah)
Let's get into it (Yeah), get stupid (Come on)
Get it started (Come on), get it started (Yeah)
Get it started

[Chorus: will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Fergie]
Let's get it started (Hah)
Let's get it started in here
Let's get it started (Hah)
Let's get it started in here
Let's get it started (Hah)
Let's get it started in here
Let's get it started (Hah)
Let's get it started in here, yeah
